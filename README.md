<p> I am a student at the University of Mauritius, studying BEng(Hons) Telecommunications Engineering with Networking.
Throughout my degree course, I was introduced to the world of coding and fell absolutely in love with it. I started my journey with JAVA language, having learnt various
concepts such Object Oriented Programming and mobile application development. Eventually I moved on to other languages such as Javascript and Python which was mostly
self-learnt in order to complete some project works.
<br>
<br>
Something I really wanted to get my hands on was Mobile App Development. I was fascinated on how mobile apps were created and implementing beautiful UI. I started 
learning Flutter Framework to be able to develop cross-platform mobile application. Here you can find some of my works, while I keep learning and expanding my skill set
on mobile application development.
